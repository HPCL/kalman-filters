# kalman filters
some kalman filters

## TODO
  * tune things
  * lapack

## basic-c
  * kalman filter and linear algebra
  * all pure C

## data_generator
  * stuff to make synthetic data
  * also contains the resulting data

## experiments
  * code for running tests and trying stuff out
  * in progress
  * note there are 2 x and y things
    * x and y in the Kalman filter for the state and measurement
    * x and y in tracking for horizontal and vertical
    * sorry this code is a mess

## kalman-cpp
  * a modified example kalman filter
  * includes version using Eigen library
  * also one that uses the basic-c filter

## kalman-lapack
  * incomplete
  * kalman filter written in lapack
  * intended for comparison

## simple-opencv-kalman-filter
  * example code using Opencv's kalman filter
