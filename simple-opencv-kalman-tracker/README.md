# modified for research by Brian Gravelle
 * Autotuning Kalman filters project
 * the program is being modified to work with a separately written kalman filter
 * this filter can be tuned for better performance
  * opencv-kalman-original is the original example
  * opencv-kalman-video is the original modified to use video files
  * opencv-kalman-original is modified to use files and our kalman filter
